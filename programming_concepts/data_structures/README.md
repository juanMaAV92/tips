1. Arrays
   - Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

## Linear Data Structures
2. Linked Lists
   - Linked lists are linear data structures where each element, known as a node, contains a value and a reference to the next node.

3. Stacks
   - Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end called the "top" of the stack.

4. Queues
   - Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end called the "rear" and removed from the other end called the "front."

## Linear Data Structures

5. Trees
   - Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. Each node may have child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship.

6. Graphs
   - Graphs consist of a set of vertices and edges connecting these vertices. They represent relationships between objects.

## Key-Value Data Structures

7. Hash Tables
   - Hash tables store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index for efficient key lookup and retrieval.

## Priority Data Structures

8. Heaps
   - Heaps are binary trees that satisfy the heap property. They can be min-heaps (minimum value at the root) or max-heaps (maximum value at the root).

## Priority Data Structures

9. Sets
   - Sets are a collection of unique elements with no particular order. They provide operations for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements.

## Priority Data Structures

10. Lists
    - Lists are ordered collections of elements. They can be indexed and allow duplicate elements. Lists provide operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements at specific positions.
